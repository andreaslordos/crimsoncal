# CrimsonCal

The most useful course calendar for picking Harvard classes.

## Deployment (Vercel)

Set the following environment variables in your Vercel project:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` | Signing secret for admin session JWTs. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password gating the `/keepout` admin panel. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Personal access token with `contents:write` on the config repo (used by the admin "publish" action). |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | GitHub user/org that hosts the deployed fork (defaults to `andreaslordos` for backward compat). |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Repo name (defaults to `crimsoncal`). |
| `VITE_SITE_URL` | Full URL for social previews (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com`). Substituted into `index.html` at build time. |

## Quick Start

### Running the App

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Data Generation

The course data comes from two sources:
1. **my.harvard** - Current course offerings and sections
2. **Q Guide** - Historical ratings, workload, and enrollment data

### Updating Course Data

#### Full Pipeline (Complete Rescrape)
Use this when you need fresh data from my.harvard:

```bash
cd scraper
./run_full_pipeline.sh
```

This will:
1. Scrape current courses from my.harvard
2. Clean and normalize the data
3. Merge with existing Q Guide data
4. Copy files to the public directory
5. Update the "Last updated" timestamp

⏱ **Time:** ~10-15 minutes depending on network speed

#### Quick Update (From Existing Data)
Use this when you've modified the merge logic but don't need to rescrape:

```bash
cd scraper
./quick_update.sh
```

This will:
1. Re-clean the existing scraped data
2. Re-merge with Q Guide data
3. Copy to public directory
4. Update timestamp

⏱ **Time:** ~5 seconds

### Data Pipeline Details

The data pipeline consists of several Python scripts:

1. **`parallel_scraper_with_reuse.py`** - Scrapes course data from my.harvard
   - Input: my.harvard website
   - Output: `results/all_courses.json`

2. **`clean_subject_catalog.py`** - Cleans course codes and extracts sections
   - Input: `results/all_courses.json`
   - Output: `results/all_courses_cleaned.json`

3. **`qguide/analyzer.py`** - Processes Q Guide historical data
   - Input: `qguide/QGuides/` HTML files
   - Output: `qguide/results/course_analytics.json`

4. **`master_merge.py`** - Merges all data sources
   - Input: `results/all_courses_cleaned.json`, `qguide/results/course_analytics.json`
   - Output: `results/master_courses.json`, `results/last_updated.json`

5. **`copy_to_public.sh`** - Copies final files to React app
   - Copies both JSON files to `public/data/`

### Manual Script Execution

If you need to run individual scripts:

```bash
cd scraper

# 1. Scrape courses (choose schools: FAS, HBS, HKS, etc.)
python3 parallel_scraper_with_reuse.py --schools "FAS"

# 2. Clean data
python3 clean_subject_catalog.py

# 3. Merge everything (uses existing Q Guide data)
python3 master_merge.py

# 4. Copy to public
./copy_to_public.sh
```

## Filters and Features

### Basic Filters
- **Search**: Course code, title, or instructor
- **Categories**: Divisional distribution and general education requirements
- **Days**: Filter by meeting days (with "only on selected days" logic)

### Advanced Filters
- **Time of Day**: Morning (9am-12pm), Afternoon (12pm-5pm), Evening (5pm-9pm)
- **Custom Time Range**: "Start after" and "End before" options
- **Schools**: Filter by Harvard school (FAS, HBS, HKS, etc.)

### Special Features
- **Multi-section Support**: Choose specific sections for courses with multiple offerings
- **Conflict Detection**: Visual indicators for time conflicts
- **Hide/Show Courses**: Temporarily hide courses from calendar while keeping them selected
- **Export**: Generate shareable URLs with your course selections

## Development

### Key Technologies
- React 18 with hooks
- Context API for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- react-window for virtualized lists (performance)
- Python for data scraping

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for course list (handles 5000+ courses smoothly)
- Debounced search with pre-computed lowercase strings
- React.memo for expensive components
- Progressive data loading with requestIdleCallback

## Troubleshooting

### Data Issues
- **Missing courses**: Re-run the full pipeline to get latest data
- **Wrong timestamps**: Check that system time is correct when running scripts
- **Q Guide data missing**: Ensure Q Guide HTML files are in `scraper/qguide/QGuides/`

### App Issues
- **Slow performance**: Clear browser cache and localStorage
- **Filters not working**: Check browser console for errors
- **Calendar not updating**: Try refreshing the page
